    """Recompute a minimum-stage safe continuation when revocation evidence
    surfaces while the rotation plan is being executed.

    The completed action prefix is non-revertible: its trust effects are
    applied to the resumption state (a completed replace_cert means the
    endpoint serves its target_chain). Chains containing a certificate with
    fresh revoked evidence — or with an unresolved fresh good/revoked
    conflict — are filtered out: a tainted current chain must be rotated
    away from, and tainted target/candidate chains are never deployed. Each
    pending replace_cert is re-targeted to one of the endpoint's clean
    chains (the declared target_chain plus up to 12 candidates); every other
    remaining action keeps its declaration. Continuation stages are numbered
    from 1 and allowed_stages apply to that numbering, with explicit no-op
    stages for sparse eligibility exactly as in /plans.

    Ties are adjudicated stably: fewest stages, then the per-action stage
    vector in action_id order, then the chosen chains' complete fingerprints
    ordered by endpoint. When no continuation exists, 409 names the first
    relationship that cannot be maintained, the blocking certificate and a
    machine-readable reason (the resumption state being already broken
    yields status invalid at stage 0).
